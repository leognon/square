# Soothing Square

A rhythm-based geometric puzzle game where you time arrow key presses to match when a red square bounces off walls, synchronized to music.

## How to Play

**Controls**:
   - **Arrow Keys**: Press when the square bounces (match the wall direction, not where the square is going!)
   - **P**: Play/Pause
   - **H**: Toggle help screen
   - **I**: Invert controls (only when help is visible)
   - **C**: Enable cheats/auto-play (only when help is visible)
   - **T**: Instant reset (explode and restart level)
   - **Click level title**: Cycle between levels (Mario, Tetris, Megalovania)
   - **Click ? button**: Show/hide help

**Gameplay**:
   - Watch the triangular indicators pointing toward bounce directions
   - Press the correct arrow key when the square hits a wall
   - Build combos for score multipliers (2x, 4x, 8x)
   - Don't run out of lives!

## Levels

- **Mario** (Super Mario Bros Theme): 3 lives, easier
- **Tetris** (Tetris Theme): 5 lives, medium
- **Megalovania** (Undertale): 10 lives, harder (240 BPM)

## Inspiration

Inspired by https://www.youtube.com/shorts/y3uKmB7ms-U.

Built for final project of MIT's Interactive Music Systems (21M.385).
The original version was written in python with Kivy.
This version was built almost entirely by Claude Code converting the python version!
